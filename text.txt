"Farmer from the outer lands
brings two sprouts which like strands
And grew two flowers on the north
One is tall and one is short

tall is thriving up to heaven, short is covering the meadow
short thought tall as a flower is disguise, why not just spread like we discussed
why not there would be many flowers, instead of only one of ours
tall is growing on it's own will, going for the heights of hill
"My beauty amount will not stop count, as I shall be seen from any route!"
"I won't follow your intent, what you're trying to pretend?" short replied
"I have made up all my ways, goodbye, I shall come to sunlight's gaze"
Then short starts to spread and tall to grow"

First Gameplay starts with tall flower
We pressing random keyboard keys to grow, for now there's only 2 or 3
Then it switches to short flower
We also pressing keys but now to spread
at first tall flower grows faster than short spreads
It continues to switch back and forth and progress further
until the growth of tall flower becomes slower and harder as the amount of keys increases

Then we given a choice
"You're almost out of breath, which choice you would take?"
"Grow"      or       "Spread"
If we choose first, the tall flower will be struggling and amount of keys will only increase
choice'll appear again and again, until the flower won't be able to continue
If we choose second, few more flowers like the tall will appear on ground
they growing as well, but slow
they weave around the tall flower, supporting
growing together and exchanging energy with each other

the flowers grow into a giant beautiful tree
while the short flowers covered all the meadow
and a hill the same height as the tree
